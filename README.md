# analytics-config-app

A client-side app for customizing configuration for a Google Tag Manager container and Google Analytics account with prebuilt tags for common use-cases.
Built with [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io).

The goal is to simplify a process that otherwise requires authentication to several Google products and rather detailed understanding of their configuration UIs.

TODO: find a better name.
